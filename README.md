# Data Analysis on Relationship between Obesity and Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors

This repository contains code for conducting exploratory data analysis on the relationship between obesity and various demographic and socioeconomic factors. The analysis is conducted using Python and utilizes a dataset provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

### Problem Definition:
To better understand the relationship between obesity and these various factors, we will conduct an exploratory data analysis. Our analysis will examine how obesity rates vary across different demographic groups and over time (the past 10 years). Additionally, we will compare obesity rates across different states in the United States to identify any meaningful differences. By doing so, we hope to shed light on the underlying factors that contribute to obesity and inform public health interventions and policies aimed at reducing obesity rates.

### Data Description:
The dataset provided by CDC contains information on adult's diet, physical activity, and weight status. The data is collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and is used for the DNPAO's Data, Trends, and Maps database. The dataset contains several variables, including demographic information, health behaviors, health status.

### Results:
The analysis reveals several interesting findings:

- There is no significant difference in obesity rates between genders. <br/>
- Higher income levels may have an effect on reducing obesity rates. <br/>
- College graduates, on average, have a lower percentage of obesity compared to those with other types of education. <br/>
- In terms of age groups, the "18-24" age group has the lowest percentage of obesity compared to other ages, while the "60 or older" group has less obesity compared to ages "35-64". <br/>
- Ethnicity also plays a role in obesity rates, with Asian Americans having a markedly lower percentage of obesity compared to other groups, while Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders have higher rates of obesity. <br/>
- Geographically, the state of Colorado has significantly lower obesity rates than the rest of the US states. <br/>
- There is a general trend of increasing obesity rates over the years, but due to the large overlap of standard deviation, it is difficult to establish statistically significant differences. However, a detailed study of obesity in considered demographic groups shows an increase in obesity over the past 10 years.

### Conclusion:
The analysis sheds light on the underlying factors that contribute to obesity and provides valuable insights for public health interventions and policies aimed at reducing obesity rates. This repository serves as a starting point for further analysis and research on the topic.
